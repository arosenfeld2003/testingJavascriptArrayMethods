# testingJavascriptArrayMethods
Rebuild native JS array methods from scratch using simple testing framework.

*Notes: 
- These methods are fairly rough, and posted for comparison and learning purposes only.
- Some are composed more cleanly than others; I have not refactored them.
- Many contain lengthy comments with information from the MDN docs of the native array method.  
- They represent various stages of my progress learning to read and write code, and getting comfortable with TDD.
- Any feedback on my approach, or potential edge cases to test that may have been missed, is much appreciated.
